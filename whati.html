        <p class="square-text">
          I have to do this for school and for this website. Is is quite fun to
          make projects and race to have the best program. The main programming
          languages that I use are VB and Python. Also coding is great because
          you can learn how to make computer do thinks like maths making some
          tasks that might take me 10 minutes to do can be done in under a
          second
        </p>
        <h3 class="square-sub-title">VB</h3>
        <p class="square-text">
          I use this for school mostly but I do sometimes make programs at home
          to practice. I like to use other languages outside of school so that I
          can expand the languages that I know. I think that VB is a good
          language to get started on because it is quite simple to make it do
          things. Also since it is built on the
          <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/" class="link"
            >.NET Framework</a
          >
          it is quite similar to C#. This is not me saying that VB and C# are
          the same language I am just saying that their syntax and some of the
          principles are similar.
        </p>
        <h3 class="square-sub-title">Python</h3>
        <p class="square-text">
          This is one of the coolest language that I know. The reasoning behind
          that statement is because of
          <a href="https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" class="link"
            >pyautogui</a
          >
          this allows me to use the keyboard inside of python. So I have made
          scrips that will send messages and open programs on my computer so
          that I don't have to. I also like python because it means that I can
          make projects very fast and get something that is very good working in
          just a few hours. I have also found that if you can do some things in
          VB it can be done more easily in Python.

          Given that we have just come out of a global pandemic it is probably
          fitting for me to talk about gaming.
