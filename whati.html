        <p class="square-text">
          I have to do this for school and for this website. Is is quite fun to
          make projects and race to have the best program. The main programming
          languages that I use are VB and Python. Also coding is great because
          you can learn how to make computer do thinks like maths making some
          tasks that might take me 10 minutes to do can be done in under a
          second
        </p>
        <h3 class="square-sub-title">VB</h3>
        <p class="square-text">
          I use this for school mostly but I do sometimes make programs at home
          to practice. I like to use other languages outside of school so that I
          can expand the languages that I know. I think that VB is a good
          language to get started on because it is quite simple to make it do
          things. Also since it is built on the
          <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/" class="link"
            >.NET Framework</a
          >
          it is quite similar to C#. This is not me saying that VB and C# are
          the same language I am just saying that their syntax and some of the
          principles are similar.
        </p>
        <h3 class="square-sub-title">Python</h3>
        <p class="square-text">
          This is one of the coolest language that I know. The reasoning behind
          that statement is because of
          <a href="https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" class="link"
            >pyautogui</a
          >
          this allows me to use the keyboard inside of python. So I have made
          scrips that will send messages and open programs on my computer so
          that I don't have to. I also like python because it means that I can
          make projects very fast and get something that is very good working in
          just a few hours. I have also found that if you can do some things in
          VB it can be done more easily in Python.

              Anyone that played on one of the many server I hosted will know
              how bad they were. They were not bad in terms of lag or
              performance, it was just the arguing in general and I am not
              talking about certain people it was just everyone on a whole.
              After all this arguing, the server would just die and then about
              2-3 days after the server dies I would take it offline and most of
              the time it would never come back.

            <span class="bold">Pi Hole (DNS): </span>
            <p class="square-text">
              In case you don't know
              <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" class="link">PiHole</a> is a
              project that was originally intended to be run on a rasberry pi.
              It is just a DNS service that will block ads for you. The way it
              does that is by having a block list of advertising servers, if a
              DNS request is made to resolve one of these domain names it will
              return a null IP address. I don't own a rasberry pi so the way I
              deployed it was using a docker container on an ubuntu server. I
              used ubuntu because it was free on aws and is widely supported so
              that if I get stuck I can get help very easily. Also, if you use
              windows then you docker has to virtualise the linux kernel on top
              of windows. After this I just used the

            <span class="bold">Caching Server: </span>
            <p class="square-text">
              If you don't know a caching server is a server that is in the way
              of the actual download server. This means that if you want to
              download a file that is installed on the download server then the
              caching server will check if the file is stored in it's cache. If
              the file is found in the cache then it will be sent across the
              local network that is normally faster than your internet and saves
              you bandwidth. In my deployment I was going to leave it running
              overnight on my laptop and then in the morining I would go on my
              computer and download the games in the cache. I used a program
              that I found on github to download games to the cache. I no longer
              use this because the server was not working and giving me really
              slow download speeds that meant it was a similar speed to just
              download the file normally.
