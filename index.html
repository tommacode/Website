        <h2 class="square-title">Who</h2>
        <p class="square-text">
          Just me, Tom. I am the only person running this website, I am the only
          one that made the website and I have full control over what goes on
          this website
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <h2 class="square-title">What</h2>
        <p class="square-text">
          This is a website that is hosted either in the cloud or on one of my
          computers
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <h2 class="square-title">How</h2>
        <p class="square-text">
          With a bit of computer know-how making a website is pretty easy.
          <br />
          The skills required are: <br />
          HTML/CSS <br />
          Mild cloud skills
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <h2 class="square-title">Where</h2>
        <p class="square-text">
          The UK. This is where I am from so I should have the least latency
          here also this is going to be where the main traffic for the site is
          comming from
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <h2 class="square-title">Why</h2>
        <p class="square-text">
          As I mentioned in one of the randomised titles, this allows me to not
          pay a subscription an have more control. I also find website builders
          have a focus on sites that have lots of images in them, this makes the
          website take a while to load and putting more stress on the server
